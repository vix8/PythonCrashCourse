Q - If a filesystem has a block size of 4096 bytes, 
    this means that a file comprised of only one byte 
    will still use 4096 bytes of storage. A file 
    made up of 4097 bytes will use 4096*2=8192 bytes of 
    storage. Knowing this, can you fill in the gaps in the 
    calculate_storage function below, which calculates the 
    total number of bytes needed to store a file of a 
    given size?
